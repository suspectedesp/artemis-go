# 🚨 ATTENTION
Please do not have anything else in a folder with artemis if you use update_project.bat because it will try to delete everything in the folder except update_project.bat which would be bad for you if you have important data in it lol

# 🌌 Artemis
 Similar to my multi-tools project, but just better

 This project supports community add-ons (extensions) because of the extensions folder, take a look at example.py in the extensions folder on how a file would need to look at least.
 
 After making a python file for this program, you need to put it into the extensions folder.

## 🤔 What exactly is this Artemis?
Basically, this is software able to run Python files that are thrown together into the extensions folder with (mostly) no problems.

It is similar to my project [multi-tools](https://github.com/vortexsys/multi-tools) but (imo) better as it is designed to support community scripts and updates.

Artemis-go is the golang version of [artemis](https://github.com/vortexsys/artemis)

This is only the standalone version though; official Python files will be [here](https://github.com/v0rtexdev/artemis)
